# Ideas
Some ideas that were introduced in the Netflix series: "Black Mirror". These technologies can be realized by using HTML. CSS, Javascript, (my)SQL and PHP.

## Yelp for people [âœ“]
Create a simple website where you can review 'people you interacted with' (Simple stock images for now).

**Implementation**
<br/>
This would literally come down to creating a simple database that houses some free stock photos (with watermark of course) on which users can enter some text and a 5 star rating. Regexes can be used to actually find common words to display in a short 'profile' summary.

**Why I chose this**
<br/>
I chose this because I could realise this pretty accurately. As far as my understanding goes, it uses a device to let people show up on the page. Of course I can't create such a device so I opted to just create a simple profile overview. Searching for common words shouldn't be that difficult. In general, a pretty cool idea to realise.

## Dating website [x]
A dating website that figures out how long you should be dating with someone. This can probably be achieved with either hard coded person traits, or some sort of open source algorithm.

**Implementation**
<br/>
Create a simple profie editor on which some common personality traits can be entered. Then research about those traits and how they effect each other. Based on that research create a function that recommends dating them or not.

## Web crawler [x]
A web crawler that searches all of the information it can about a specific person. Maybe use facial recognition to filter for pictures?

**Implementation**
<br/>
Just find a webcrawler that can be modified to the point that it can search for personal information about a given name.
